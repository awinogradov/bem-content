Use [bower-npm-install](https://github.com/arikon/bower-npm-install) to install bem-components from GitHub or Bower register.

Add levels from bem-content to your `make.js` file:

    // blocks with accessebility templates overriding
    'libs/bem-content/accessebility.blocks'
]

    ]
}

See more examples in `promo.pages/index/index.bemjson.js` (build it with `bem make`) or on [landing page](http://verybigman.github.io/bem-content).

## Calculating

Lib have block `calc` for calculating fonts sizes. Any sizes writed in rem. It's absolutely right way for fonts. For more info about math model you can watch [here](https://github.com/verybigman/bem-content/blob/master/common.blocks/calc/calc.en.md).

## Customize

Lib very simple to customize. You can configure everything. 
To do this you need create block `variables` on one of levels in your project and override any variable in it. So, list of variables you can watch [here](https://github.com/verybigman/bem-content/blob/master/common.blocks/variables/variables.styl).
